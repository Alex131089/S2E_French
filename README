*****

The application installs a script, that allows you to move applications, data and some cache to sd-ext partition and back. You can specify what needs to be moved from within the application

Supports moving to sd-ext:
- App and Private app
- Applications data
- Dalvik and download cache

Supports mounting sd-ext as ext4

Moving Applications data (/data/data) to sd-ext - Lower performance!!!
